## ⚠️ Common Cybersecurity Threats in Healthcare

| Threat Type        | What It Does                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phishing Emails** 🎣 | Tricks users into clicking fake links or downloading malware disguised as lab results, invoices, or IT alerts |
| **Ransomware** 💰     | Locks access to patient records or systems until a ransom is paid; can delay care and compromise safety |
| **Malware** 🧟        | Infects devices, spreads silently, and steals data; some turn systems into “zombies” (e.g., Emotet, TrickBot) |
| **Data Breaches** 🔓  | Exposes sensitive health information, often due to weak passwords or unsecured devices |
| **Social Engineering** 🎭 | Manipulates staff into revealing credentials or bypassing security protocols |

## ✅ Best Practices for Everyday Protection

- 🔐 **Use strong, unique passwords**  
  Avoid pet names, birthdays, or repeats; consider a password manager

- 📲 **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  Adds a second layer of protection to logins

- 👀 **Verify before clicking**  
  Hover over links, check sender addresses, and trust your instincts

- 🔄 **Update software regularly**  
  Patches fix vulnerabilities, don’t delay

- 🚪 **Lock unattended devices**  
  Always log out or lock screens in shared spaces

- 📣 **Report suspicious activity**  
  Even if you’re unsure, better safe than sorry

## 🤝 Cybersecurity Starts With Us

- 🧠 **Stay Curious**: Ask questions about suspicious emails, login requests, or device behavior  
- 📣 **Speak Up**: If something feels off, report it; your instinct might protect the whole network  
- 🧰 **Support Each Other**: Help coworkers set up MFA, spot phishing attempts, or update devices  
- 🧼 **Model Good Habits**: Lock your screen, verify links, and share what you learn  
- 🧭 **Lead by Example**: Whether you’re clinical, admin, or tech; your habits set the tone

> **Cybersecurity isn’t just a checklist; it’s a culture.**  
> Every action builds trust, safety, and resilience.
